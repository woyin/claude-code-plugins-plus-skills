## What Changed: Claude Code in 2026

Anthropic shipped several features since plugins launched in October 2025 that change how developers extend Claude Code:

- **Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`)** replaced static plugins as the primary extension point. Skills auto-activate based on conversation context — no slash commands needed. This repo now contains 1,916 validated skills across 22 categories.
- **`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`** is the official path variable for referencing files within a skill directory. It replaced the deprecated `{baseDir}` syntax. All 1,916 skills in this repo use the current variable.
- **Two-tier validation**: Standard tier (default) follows the Anthropic spec with no required fields. Enterprise tier (`--enterprise`) applies the Intent Solutions 100-point grading rubric. CI auto-selects enterprise.
- **Progressive Disclosure Architecture (PDA)** keeps skill files concise (target: 150 lines) and offloads detailed references to a `references/` subdirectory. Our 100-point grading rubric enforces this.
- **Tool permissions** (`allowed-tools` frontmatter) give each skill fine-grained access control. Scoped patterns like `Bash(git:*)` limit what system commands a skill can run.
- **New frontmatter fields**: `context: fork` (run in subagent), `agent` (subagent type), `user-invocable` (hide from slash menu), `argument-hint` (autocomplete), `hooks` (lifecycle events), and `compatibility` (AgentSkills.io standard for environment requirements).
- **Claude 4.5/4.6 model family** — Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 are the current models. Skills can specify `model: sonnet` or `model: opus` in frontmatter.

This README reflects the current state of the ecosystem as of March 2026.

---

## Quick Start

**Option 1: CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
pnpm add -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi
ccpi search devops              # Find plugins by keyword
ccpi install devops-automation-pack
ccpi list --installed           # See what's installed
ccpi update                     # Pull latest versions
```

**Option 2: Claude Built-in Commands**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins
/plugin install devops-automation-pack@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

> Already using an older install? Run `/plugin marketplace remove claude-code-plugins` and re-add with the command above to switch to the new slug.

**Browse the catalog:** Visit **[claudecodeplugins.io](https://claudecodeplugins.io/)** or explore [`plugins/`](./plugins/)

## How Agent Skills Work

Agent Skills are instruction files (`SKILL.md`) that teach Claude Code **when** and **how** to perform specific tasks. Unlike commands that require explicit `/slash` triggers, skills activate automatically when Claude detects relevant conversation context.

### The Activation Flow

```
1. INSTALL     /plugin install ansible-playbook-creator@claude-code-plugins-plus
2. STARTUP     Claude reads SKILL.md frontmatter → learns trigger phrases
3. ACTIVATE    You say "create an ansible playbook for Apache"
4. EXECUTE     Claude matches trigger → reads full skill → follows instructions
```

### What a Skill Looks Like

```yaml
---
name: ansible-playbook-creator
description: |
  Generate production-ready Ansible playbooks. Use when automating server
  configuration or deployments. Trigger with "ansible playbook" or
  "create playbook for [task]".
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash(ansible:*), Glob
version: 2.0.0
author: Jeremy Longshore <jeremy@intentsolutions.io>
license: MIT

# Ansible Playbook Creator

## Overview
Generates idempotent Ansible playbooks following infrastructure-as-code best practices.

## Instructions
1. Gather target host details and desired state
2. Select appropriate Ansible modules
3. Generate playbook with proper variable templating
4. Validate syntax with `ansible-lint`

## Output
- Complete playbook YAML ready for `ansible-playbook` execution
```

### The Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total skills | 1,916 |
| Plugins (marketplace) | 346 |
| Plugin categories | 22 |
| Contributors | 16 |
| Average skill grade | B (89.9/100) |
| Production ready (A+B) | 88.9% |

---

## Plugin Types

### AI Instruction Plugins (98%)
Markdown files that guide Claude's behavior through structured instructions, skills, commands, and agents. No external code — everything runs through Claude's built-in capabilities.

### MCP Server Plugins (2%)
TypeScript applications that run as separate Node.js processes. Claude communicates with them through the Model Context Protocol. Currently 7 MCP plugins providing 21 tools.

### SaaS Skill Packs
Pre-built skill collections for specific platforms — Deepgram, LangChain, Linear, Gamma, and 20+ others. Each pack includes install/auth, core workflows, debugging, deployment, and advanced pattern skills.

---

## Skill Quality: 100-Point Grading

Every skill in this marketplace is automatically graded on a 100-point scale across five dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Progressive Disclosure | 30 pts | File length, references/ usage, navigation |
| Ease of Use | 25 pts | Metadata quality, discoverability, workflow clarity |
| Utility | 20 pts | Problem solving, flexibility, error handling, examples |
| Spec Compliance | 15 pts | Frontmatter validity, naming, description quality |
| Writing Style | 10 pts | Imperative voice, objectivity, conciseness |

Grades: **A** (90-100), **B** (80-89), **C** (70-79), **D** (60-69), **F** (<60)

Run the validator yourself:
```bash
python3 scripts/validate-skills-schema.py --skills-only              # Standard tier (default, no required fields)
python3 scripts/validate-skills-schema.py --enterprise --skills-only  # Enterprise tier (marketplace rubric)
python3 scripts/validate-skills-schema.py --verbose --skills-only     # Detailed breakdowns
python3 scripts/validate-skills-schema.py --show-low-grades           # Find D+F skills
```

## Building Your Own

### Templates

| Template | Includes | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **minimal-plugin** | plugin.json + README | Simple utilities |
| **command-plugin** | Slash commands | Custom workflows |
| **agent-plugin** | Specialized AI agent | Domain expertise |
| **full-plugin** | Commands + agents + hooks + skills | Complex automation |

All templates live in [`templates/`](templates/).

### Step by Step

1. Copy a template: `cp -r templates/command-plugin my-plugin`
2. Edit `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with your metadata
3. Add your skill to `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
4. Validate: `ccpi validate ./my-plugin`
5. Submit a pull request
