# PRD: Cross-Chain Bridge Monitor

## Summary
**One-liner**: Monitor cross-chain bridge activity, liquidity, and security status
**Domain**: Cryptocurrency / Bridge Infrastructure
**Users**: DeFi users, Developers, Security researchers

## Problem Statement
Cross-chain bridges are critical infrastructure but also high-risk targets. Users need real-time visibility into bridge health, liquidity, transaction status, and security incidents to make informed bridging decisions.

## User Stories

1. As a DeFi user, I want to check bridge liquidity before initiating a transfer, so that I don't get stuck with delayed withdrawals.

2. As a trader, I want to compare bridge fees and transfer times across providers, so that I can choose the most cost-effective route.

3. As a security researcher, I want to monitor bridge TVL changes, so that I can detect potential exploits or unusual activity.

4. As a developer, I want to track my pending bridge transactions, so that I can provide accurate status updates to users.

## Functional Requirements

- REQ-1: Fetch and display bridge TVL across supported protocols
- REQ-2: Track bridge liquidity by chain and token
- REQ-3: Monitor pending and completed bridge transactions
- REQ-4: Compare bridge fees and estimated transfer times
- REQ-5: Alert on significant TVL changes or security incidents
- REQ-6: Support multiple bridge protocols (Wormhole, LayerZero, Stargate, Across, etc.)

## API Integrations

- **DefiLlama Bridges API**: Bridge TVL, volume, and protocol data
- **Bridge Protocol APIs**: Protocol-specific transaction status
- **RPC Endpoints**: On-chain verification of bridge transactions
- **Security Feeds**: Bridge exploit alerts and audit status

## Success Metrics

- Activation triggers correctly on bridge-related queries
- TVL and liquidity data accurate within 5 minutes
- Transaction status tracking 99% reliable
- Fee estimates within 10% of actual costs

## Non-Goals

- Executing bridge transactions (read-only monitoring)
- Providing trading advice or recommendations
- Real-time arbitrage detection
- Private/permissioned bridge monitoring
